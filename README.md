# DoctorNote


* DoctorNote was a test application using OkHTTP to send network requests that fill up a google forms/spreadsheet. 
* I added Firebaase Analytics to the app as well. 
* The application is no longer in use, but you can fork the project and make changes as you so please
* Please note: this app was meant for a bilingual audience, so I "hacked" in the hebrew and english conversions. In addition, to deal with the different responses, the switch case method needs some improvement.
